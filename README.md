## Resources

There are 15 kinds of built-in resources in *AdaSociety*, which can be divided into *Natural Resources* and *Synthesized Resources* based on whether they can be produced through events. Some of the natural resources can only be discovered and gathered by agents with certain resources (denoted by *Requirement*) in their inventories.

| Resource  | Wood | Stone | Hammer | Coal | Torch | Iron | Steel | Shovel | Pickaxe | GemMine | Clay | Pottery | Cutter | Gem | Totem |

| Objective reward | 1 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 20 | 3 | 30 | 100 | 150 | 4 | 4 | 40 | 100 | 200 | 1000 |

## Events

There are 9 built-in events in *AdaSociety*. Each event takes 2 to 3 kinds of resources as input and outputs 1 kind of product. Events can only be observed and executed by agents whose inventories meet the event requirements.

| Event | Input1 | Input2 | Input3 | Output | Requirement1 | Requirement2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| HammerCraft | 1Wood | 1Stone | - | 1Hammer | - | - |

## Inventories

Every agent has an inventory with maximal capacities of every resource, implying skill diversity. For example, an agent with a $0$ capacity for hammers cannot possess hammers and observe coal. Agents can collect resources from the map into their inventories and dump resources on the map. Agents' rewards are attached to the resources in their inventories, while they exhibit heterogeneity in resource preferences. Specifically, for agent $i$, the reward of resource $\rho$ is $R_i(\rho) = m_i^{\rho} \cdot h_i(\rho) \cdot \overline{r}^{\rho}$, where $m_i^{\rho}$ is the amount of resource $\rho$ in the inventory of agent $i$, $h_i(\rho) \in \mathbb{R}$ represents the preference of agent $i$ for $\rho$, $\overline{r}^{\rho}$ is the objective reward of a unit of $\rho$.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We plan to publish this repository as a Python package in the future.

## Customization
***AdaSociety*** offers two primary methods for customizing the multi-agent environment:

1. **JSON Configuration**: Users can easily adjust environment parameters by passing settings in JSON format. Customizable configurations include:
   - Map size
   - Number, location and generation method  of blocks
   - Types and quantities of resources
   - Event types and their respective quantities and generation methods
   - Initial social structure and its evolution
   - Specification of pre-update and post-update functions for each environment step
   - Number of agents, their inventory capacity, and preferences

   Additionally, users can customize non-built-in resources, events, and agent types. For a detailed description, please refer to [JSON Configuration File Documentation](./config/README.md).

2. **Custom Python Code**: Users can gain greater flexibility and control by crafting custom `env_handler` and `agent` classes through Python code. This allows for:
   - Implementation of custom observation processing functions and reward functions
   - Action translations for agents
   - Application of meta control within the environment, such as defining the rotation order of agents.

		For a detailed description, please refer to [Agent and Environment Handler Implementation](./project/agent/README.md).

## Mini-games
For detailed instructions on each mini-game, consult the following documents: 
 - [Contract](./project/tasks/contract/README.md)
 - [Exploration](./project/tasks/exploration/README.md)
 - [Negotiation](./project/tasks/negotiation/README.md)
 - [Social Structure](./project/tasks/social_structure/README.md)

## Running and Training

Here are some key files and folders to run the environment and train the agents:

- **Environment running:** `project/env/` is the main folder in which ***AdaSociety*** runs. It contains the important components, such as **event**, **resource**, **player**.

- **Agents training:** ***AdaSociety*** is a general environment that supports implementing arbitrary algorithms on top of it and is compatible with all popular RL libraries.

We implemented an adaptation of ***AdaSociety*** for the well-known library [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html). `project/RLlib/` contains the modules needed to train agents using the RLlib framework, like `network` and `policy`. `train/train.py` in this folder is the main script which creates the environment instance and runs the RL algorithm.`rllib_train.py` serves as the entry point for executing the training process. It reads and processes command-line arguments and passes the parsed arguments to `RLlib/train.py` to configure the training run. 

Please check further details and examples for using RLlib for ***AdaSociety*** in [Training agents via RLlib in *AdaSociety*](./project/RLlib/README.md).

***AdaSociety*** also supports using LLM to control agents. We provide an implementation, and please see [LLM](./project/tasks/llm) for details.
